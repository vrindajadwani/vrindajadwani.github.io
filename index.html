			<h3>A Short Poem (Credits- Abimbola T. Alabi) </h3> 
			<p>You always answer when I call</p>
			<p>And help me up if I should fall,</p>
			<p>But you never complain at all</p>
			<p>You confront me when I am wrong</p>
			<p>But will never scold me for long,</p>
			<p>Instead, you try to keep me strong</p>
			<p>You know the funny things to say</p>
			<p>To make me laugh my fears away.</p>
			<p>Like the sun, you brighten my day</p>
			<p>You see in me gifts I deny</p>
			<p>And urge me to give things a try.</p>
			<p>You spread for me my wings to fly</p>
			<p>You always perceive what I need</p>
			<p>And offer it before I plead.</p>
			<p>Just like a book, my mind you read</p>
			<p>You value little things I do</p>
			<p>But won't brag of what you do too.</p>
			<p>How can I ever repay you?</p>
			<p>And greatest of all I have found</p>
			<p>When times are tough and I'm down,</p>
			<p>You are the one who sticks around,</p>
			<p>My true friend.</p>
